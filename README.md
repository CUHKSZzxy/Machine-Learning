>"_Stay hungry, stay foolish._"


**This is a repository for Machine Learning Courses given by _Andrew NG_. Thanks for his marvelous ML courses!**

  Personally speaking, this course is relatively simple but well-designed and comprehensive. I basically record some of the notes that i wrote when i was listening to the courses. Taking notes by yourself and finish corresponding assignments are highly preferred.   
Here is the catagory:  
  * Assignment
    * Ex1
    * Ex2
    * Ex3
    * Ex4
    * Ex5
    * Ex6
    * Ex7
    * Ex8
  * Lecture notes
  
  All the assignments reference solutions are provided in this repository, however, worth noticing is that, the answer may not be the best one and may contain some typos and errors. Additionally, I also referred to the answer given by [_suraggupta_](https://github.com/suraggupta/coursera-machine-learning-solutions-python).    
  If you are interested in this, the complete python, jupyter notebook version assignment can be found [here][reference].
